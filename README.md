You were moving a litter of kitten from the barn to the house when you hit a rock and the kittens fell out. OH NO! They're just babies, so it's important that we get them back in the wheelbarrow before they all run away. But have no fear, you can use CSS selectors to put the kittens back in the wheelbarrow. 

## Let's Get Coding

###Step 1:

In Learn.co, view the Album Cover lab. Click on `Open in Nitrous` in the top left corner:

### Step 2:

We're going to be using `index.html as a reference, and coding our solutions in `css/place-kitty.css`.

You'll want to look on the left side of Nitrous (the file navigator) and look at `Nitrous < Code < Labs < HS Kitten Wheelbarrow`. To open the files to edit them, you can use the file navigator on the left side. Double click on `index.html` and and `place-kitty.css` to open them in the text editor.


### Step 3

You'll want to keep the `index.html` file open in both the Nitrous text editor, and the browser. To view the file in the browser, enter

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000
```

Once you have the server running, select `preview` and then `port 3000`.

### Step 4

Use your knowledge of CSS selectors to fill in the appropriate selectors to move the kittens into the wheelbarrow. Feel free to look back at previous lessons for a refresher on CSS selectors.

### Step 5

Don't forget to save your changes before you refresh in the browser. Also, remember to shut down your server when you're done with this lab so you can keep working!

### Step 6

Lastly, you need to save your code to GitHub and mark this lab as done in Learn by entering in Nitrous, in terminal `learn submit`.
